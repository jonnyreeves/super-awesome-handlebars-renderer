# Super-Awesome Handlebars Renderer

Simple tool for rendering handlebars templates with JSON values. Useful for building up HTML emails that use handlebars tokens for mail-merge (e.g. MailChimp) or for general app templates.

Stores the HTML and JSON in localstorage just in case you accidentally close your browser window with super-awesome work-in-progress.

Clone and run `npm start` to install, build and run a server at `http://localhost:3003`.
